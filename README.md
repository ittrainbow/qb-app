App calculating QB passer rating with DPI pet-project.

React, React Table, Firebase Auth.

I truly believe that QBs often looking for DPI opportunities 'cause they move the chains, they bring yards and 1st downs, so DPIs should count as completions in final stats.

Here's only two seasons of play stats filled manually while I was not able to find data source to fetch. Furthermore, endzone DPIs count as DPIs at 1 yd line in Gamebook so I was forced to go through the game films to surely identify em as endzone interferences.

And actual affect of those completions is not really significant (91.1 and 92.4 rating numbers for Rodgers' 2022 season) so I stopped mining this data.
